A basic YouTube viderooo downloader web GUI that runs in a docker container

### Background:
There aren't really any self-hosted YouTube video downloader web applications that I was able to find on Github. I only searched for a few minutes though, so I'm sure there are some out there, maybe. Or maybe YouTube broke into the houses of those who had such self-hosted applications published on Github and kidnapped their families unless they took the repo down or went private. Either way, I've notified my family and we're ready for you Google.

## Objectives:
- Query: 
    Query a video via a YouTube URL and return information about the video.
- Download:
    Download a video to either the server or the server and the browser. Allow choosing the quality.


## Implemented:
- Query:
    Query a video via a YouTube URL and return information about the video.
- Download:
    Download a video to either the server or the server and the browser. Allows for choosing the quality.
    None of the available stream resolutions were progressive except for 360p. Bummer.
    1. Download video stream at the requested resolution
    2. Download the highest quality audio stream
    3. Stitch these fellas together using ffmpeg
    4. Leave the video on the server in the ./downloaded-videos folder
    5. Pass it back to the browser if requested
